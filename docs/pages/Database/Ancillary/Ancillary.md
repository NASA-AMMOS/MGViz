## Tables

### url_shorteners

The `url_shorteners` table stores mappings between short links (a short character sequence) and full links as well as the user who created the short link. Short links enable the sharing of a concise link (such as mmgis.jpl.nasa.gov/?s=mdxeg) instead of a full 1k+ character deep link.
